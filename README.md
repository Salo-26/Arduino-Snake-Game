# Snake Game using Arduino and LCD Display

This project implements a simple Snake game on an Arduino board with an LCD display. The game allows players to control a snake, eat apples, and grow in length without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.

## Hardware Requirements
1. Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano)
2. LCD display (compatible with LiquidCrystal library)
3. Push buttons for user input (e.g., left, right)
4. Potentiometer (optional, for adjusting LCD contrast)
5. Breadboard and jumper wires

## Software Requirements
1. Arduino IDE
2. LiquidCrystal library (for LCD display)
3. Standard C libraries (e.g., stdlib.h, limits.h)

## Installation and Setup
1. Connect the Arduino board to the computer and open the Arduino IDE.
2. Install the LiquidCrystal library if not already installed (`Sketch` > `Include Library` > `Manage Libraries`).
3. Copy and paste the provided code into the Arduino IDE.
4. Adjust the pin configurations in the code to match your hardware setup (LCD, buttons, etc.).
5. Upload the code to the Arduino board and ensure it runs without errors.

## Gameplay Instructions
1. Use the left and right buttons to control the snake's direction.
2. Guide the snake to eat apples (represented as 'B' on the LCD) to grow in length.
3. Avoid collisions with the walls and the snake's own body.
4. The game ends when the snake collides or fills the entire screen.

## Code Structure
- `setup()`: Initializes the LCD display, buttons, and game state.
- `loop()`: Main game loop handling input, game logic, and display updates.
- `game_init()`: Initializes the game state, positions, and apple spawning.
- `game_calculate_logic()`: Calculates snake movement, collisions, and apple consumption.
- `game_calculate_display()`: Updates the LCD display based on the game state.
- `graphic_generate_characters()`: Generates custom characters for snake and apple graphics.
- `graphic_clear()`, `graphic_add_item()`, `graphic_flush()`: Functions for managing LCD graphics.

## Credits
- This project is inspired by classic Snake games and various Arduino tutorials.
- The code utilizes concepts of game logic, display management, and input handling.

## Future Improvements
- Add scoring system and high-score tracking.
- Implement levels with increasing difficulty.
- Include sound effects or additional gameplay features.
- Optimize code for better performance or add comments for clarity.
